Command Line Interface
======================

There are numerous tools in python to help you create a command line
interface. Some of these include ``click``, ``docopt``, and SO many
others. Personally I have found that ``argparse`` in the standard
library does 90% of the things that I need in a command line. Since
``argparse`` is in the stdlib full documentation is available `argparse
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>`_
