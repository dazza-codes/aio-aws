Packaging
=========

In this section I will talk about how create a simple python package
that can be installed using ``python setup.py install``. These are the
basics sharing your package with other users. In order to get your
package to install with ``pip`` you will need to complete the steps in
this guide and :doc:`pypi`. The reason is that this guide only shows
how to let someone install your package if they have the package
directory on their machine.

The most important file is the ``setup.py`` file.
