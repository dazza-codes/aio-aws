Documentation
=============

Documenting a python project is a daunting task. Even though I myself
have had experience with documentation it always takes me time to get
it setup just right.

`yaml configuration readthedocs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml-config.html?highlight=.readthedocs.yml>`


sphinx_rtd_theme use it. ``pip install sphinx_rtd_theme``.
